The benefits of good unit tests are that they make sure that your functions are actually producing the intended answer for every situation. Without testing your functions, there could be situations where your function produces the correct result for your sample variables by sheer coincidence but produces incorrect results in every other situation. Its always best to make sure that your code is always working as intended.
